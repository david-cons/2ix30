    "This is a real-world data set, meaning that it is **messy**. Two key difficulties are categorial features and missing values.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Categorical Features\n",
    "Many (implementations of) machine learning algorithms cannot handle categorical features automatically. This is often dealt with through *one-hot-encoding*, where each category of a feature is transformed into a binary feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a feature contains many categories, this results in a very sparse data set with many features. As such, it can be worthwile to use domain expertise to merge particular categories in order to reduce the number of one-hot-encoded features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Values\n",
    "The data set contains a lot of missing values (around 35% of the values is missing). There are several ways to deal with this, some ideas to try:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Replace missing values with the mean (numerical features) or median (categorical features), e.g., using [`SimpleImputer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#univariate-feature-imputation).\n",
    "* Drop features with many missing values.\n",
    "* Model-based imputation strategies, such as [KNNImputer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#nearest-neighbors-imputation).\n",
    "* Domain-knowledge inspired replacement. For example, for features related to medical measurements, it is expected that the entered data is abnormal in some way. As such, replacing by the mean or median can paint a skewed picture. One way to deal with this would be to identify a normal range for different measurements, based on domain expertise. *Note: this is a very time consuming strategy which we do not necessarily recommend in the time span of this project.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage you to try several approaches and see what works best."

    "# APACHE IV Scores\n",
    "APACHE (\"Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation\") is a scoring system assessing severity of illness and prognoses of ICU patients. The scoring system has been improved over time, with APACHE II being released in 1985, APACHE III in 1991, and finally APACHE IV in 2006. APACHE IV has been evaluated and validated in patients for mortality outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset, the *apache_4a_hospital_death_prob* column corresponds to the APACHE IV probabilistic prediction of in-hospital mortality for the patient which utilizes the APACHE III score and other covariates, including diagnosis.\n",
    "* `-1` means the score couldn't be calculated for some reason. In particular, the patient encounter could have been a re-admission. \n",
    "* `NaN` indicates a missing score, due to e.g., a missing covariate that made it impossible to compute the score. \n"
