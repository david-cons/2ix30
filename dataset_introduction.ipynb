    "### Missing Values\n",

    "\n",
    "* Replace missing values with the mean (numerical features) or median (categorical features), e.g., using [`SimpleImputer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#univariate-feature-imputation).\n",
    "* Drop features with many missing values.\n",
    "* Model-based imputation strategies, such as [KNNImputer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#nearest-neighbors-imputation).\n",
    "* Domain-knowledge inspired replacement. For example, for features related to medical measurements, it is expected that the entered data is abnormal in some way. As such, replacing by the mean or median can paint a skewed picture. One way to deal with this would be to identify a normal range for different measurements, based on domain expertise. *Note: this is a very time consuming strategy which we do not necessarily recommend in the time span of this project.*\n",
